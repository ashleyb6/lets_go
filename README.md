# lets_go

Description:

Let'sGo is a small app that I have created for personal use on my desktop.
As a stay-at-home mother, feeling isolated at home is something that I 
often struggle with. There are days when I cannot find motivation to plan
an out-of-the-house activity to do with the kids. I figured, if I could just
click a button and a random activity would generate for me, that would motivate me
to grab the keys, get the kids in their carseats, and go do it.

I know several parents struggle with these same feelings that I do, so I think from a real-world 
perspective this could be a useful application. I plan to keep this in mind as I code through this 
project and perhaps deploy it for others in the future.

Developed using Python 3.10 in PyCharm, 
using the tkinter package to design my interface. 

====================

Functions:

generate_random()
  - generate a random activity to display in the window
  
generate_specified()
  - allow user to select from a number of options (inside, outside, free, cheap, etc) to narrow down an activity for the day

add_activity()
  - add an activity to the csv file of all activities

delete_activity()
  - delete an activity from the csv file

update()
  - display pop-up window to prompt user to either add or delete from list of activities
